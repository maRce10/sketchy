# sketchy: create custom research compendiums

\`sketchy\` is intended to facilitate the use of research compendiums
for data analysis in the R environment. Standard research compendiums
provide a easily recognizable means for organizing digital materials,
allowing other researchers to inspect, reproduce, and build upon that
research.

## Details

The main features of the package are:

- Creation of (customized) folder structure

- Simplify the inclusion of big data files with version control software
  and online collaborative platforms (e.g. github)

License: GPL (\>= 2)
